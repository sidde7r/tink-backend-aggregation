* Make sure the blast radius of potential failure is small and you know how to roll back.
* If you need, seek feedback from other teams if code is touching them.
* Follow [Tink Code review best practices](https://book-of.tink.network/engineering/software/code_review/) and [Tink Secure Development Cheatsheet](https://book-of.tink.network/engineering/security/cheatsheets/secure-development/)
