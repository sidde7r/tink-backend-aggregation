# You need to have python installed in your PATH and python 2 is currently

#   $ brew install python2

# The bazel server needs to be restarted to pick up on the changed Python

#   $ bazel shutdown
#
# If you want to use the images inside Minikube, connect to the Docker daemon
# running on the inside:
#   $ eval $(minikube docker-env)

# Currently consumable docker images can be produced by running:
#   $ bazel build docker:bundle.tar
#   $ docker load -i bazel-bin/docker/bundle.tar
