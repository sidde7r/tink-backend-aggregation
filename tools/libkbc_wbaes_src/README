This library implements a white-box AES encryption for the use in the
KBC agent. The key has been "encoded"/transformed into multiple tables,
kbc_XXX.c, which is used in the encryption.

The original source code was taken from https://github.com/jeffsaremi/wbaes

The library depends on m4ri which can be installed with:
# apt-get install libm4ri-dev

or with brew for macOS:
# brew tap brewsci/homebrew-science
# brew install brewsci/science/m4ri
