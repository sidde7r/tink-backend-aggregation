This library implements a white-box AES encryption for the use in the
KBC agent. The key has been "encoded"/transformed into multiple tables,
kbc_XXX.c, which is used in the encryption.

The original source code was taken from https://github.com/jeffsaremi/wbaes

The library depends on m4ri which can be installed with:
# apt-get install libm4ri-dev

or with brew for macOS:
# brew tap brewsci/homebrew-science
# brew install brewsci/science/m4ri

If you want to rebuild the library for whatever reason run from this directory:
# docker build . -t lib_wbaes_builder
# docker run --rm -ti -v "$PWD:/usr/src/libkbc_wbaes" lib_wbaes_builder

you'll find the output file libkbc_wbaes.so in the same directory from when you
run the docker run command.
