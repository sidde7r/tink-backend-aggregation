baseUrl-description: |2
    This is the base URL or base location, which helps in converting relative web
    URLs on the specific page to absolute web URLs.

baseUrl-example: |2
    "https://www.tink.com"

redirectUrls-description: |2
    From https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/: Redirect URLs are a
    critical part of the OAuth flow. After a user successfully authorizes an
    application, the authorization server will redirect the user back to the
    application with either an authorization code or access token in the URL.
    Because the redirect URL will contain sensitive information, it is critical
    that the service doesn’t redirect the user to arbitrary locations.

    This is a list of allowed redirectUrls that can be used when receiving a request.
    When a request is received by the agent that requires a redirectUrl, if a
    redirectUrl is included in such request, it is checked agains this list, if it
    is not present, the request will fail. If no redirectUrl is included in the
    request, the first one from the list will be used.

    It is optional if a list of allowed redirectUrls has been specified in the common
    configuration.

redirectUrls-example: |2
    ["https://api.tink.se/api/v1/credentials/third-party/callback", "https://main.staging.fakeenvironment.tink.se/api/v1/credentials/third-party/callback"]

clientId-description: |2
    From https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/: The
    client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it's public, it's best that
    it isn't guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a
    32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the
    authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly
    easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications.

clientId-example: |2
    "555d5513cb123456789050b90f06a18b21234567890a9cce977c5513734d3f41"

clientSecret-description: |2
    From https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/: The
    client_secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.
    It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable, which means you should avoid
    using common UUID libraries which often take into account the timestamp or MAC
    address of the server generating it. A great way to generate a secure secret is to
    use a cryptographically-secure library to generate a 256-bit value and converting it
    to a hexadecimal representation.

clientSecret-example: |2
    "042cfdf1234567890ad83d622d7563aa2412345678900d8fd891c490f183c6da"
