     * NOTE: all responses for requests made by browser will go through this code first before they
     * reach browser back. This means that all debug breakpoints put here may cause browser requests
     * to fail because of timeout. Also, when this code hangs a on breakpoint, some websites may not
     * be interactable.
     *
     * <p>Additionally, the JavaScript that initializes BankID iframe is very sensitive to any
     * network delays for first few http requests. If you stop on a breakpoint here before iframe is
     * fully initialized, it will almost certainly interpret it as some network issues and cause
     * iframe initialization to fail (probably due to some security reasons).
     *
     * <p>Finally, although this code will be run in a separate thread, this thread can also be
     * stopped by some breakpoints in other parts of application. The default IntelliJ breakpoint
     * setting is to stop all threads. Again, this may cause BankID iframe initialization to fail.
     * To change this behavior: right click on any breakpoint, select "Thread" radio button (not
     * "All") and click "Make default" button. This way breakpoints in other parts of application
     * will not stop this thread (but you may also have to disable already existing ones).
