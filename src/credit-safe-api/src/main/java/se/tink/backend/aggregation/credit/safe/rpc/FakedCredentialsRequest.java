 * Since all requests to agent implementations need a credentials to be able to instantiate the AgentContext, we

 *
 * Creates a fake credential (that isn't stored in DB, and should never be updated with accounts etc.), to be used
 * for operations on agents that doesn't require a credential already. Operations as this could be e.g. getting
 * product information for a user to do mortgage switching.
 *
 * Note that this probably makes it impossible to ask for supplemental information since the credential never should
 * be stored in the DB.
