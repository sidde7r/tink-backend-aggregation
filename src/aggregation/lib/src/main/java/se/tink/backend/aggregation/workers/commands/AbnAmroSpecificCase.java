/**
 * This is a special command that will only do something for nl-abnamro provider. This provider is a
 * special provider that is only used by ABN Amro themselves to authenticate the user in GRIP app,
 * using ABN Amro's Internet Banking app. Not having this command causes us to throw away
 * Transactions in the ABN Amro-specific (legacy) Connector. Once ABN Amro has migrated away from
 * the old Connector, and use the generic one, this command can be removed. See this thread for more
 * information: https://tink.slack.com/archives/CB12SB8DV/p1588672355268300
 *
 * <p>This command needs to be after SendAccountsToUpdateServiceAgentWorkerCommand as
 * SendAccountsToUpdateServiceAgentWorkerCommand has side effects on the AgentContext The result of
 * this command did exist previously in the AbnAmroAgent but was accidentally remove in commit
 * 04a559c27a4731c117372228eda95dcf211f1024. Now it is not possible to put it in the Agent anymore
 * as the flow looks different now and as stated before, this needs to happen after accounts have
 * been send to UpdateService.
