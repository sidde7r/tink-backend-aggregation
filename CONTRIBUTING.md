## Git

### Commit messages

TL;DR

- First line max length: `72 chars` (preferably 50 chars)
- Format:
```
tag(Category) Message

Details
```
- Example:
```
fix(LF/TransferData) Make getAccounts() null-safe

We got NPE when calling the getAccounts() method, so return new list if value is null.
```


Since we're quite many people working on the same repo right now, in order to make the log useful we want to structure our git commit messages.

The first line should be <= 72 chars long, since after 72 chars GitHub breaks the line and puts a `...` button on the side. For messages longer you add a `\n` and write more details on the next line after that.

Preferably first line should be <= 50 chars for readability purposes, but that's not required at this time.

This purpose is to make it easier for e.g. a person in the `Platform` team to understand at a glimpse what has changed regarding `Integration` that might affect deployments and reasons to do rollbacks of recent deploys. Or for a person in the same team to understand what the others have been up to lately regarding code changes.

#### tag

Current tags:
- `doc` -> Documentation only
- `fea` -> Feature
- `fix` -> Bug fix
- `log` -> Logging purpose only commits
- `per` -> Performance improvements
- `ref` -> Refactoring commit
- `sty` -> Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `tes` -> Tests only commit

...if we need more tags that these doesn't cover, just add more. The reasoning is to keep them at 3 chars width, to save space in the first line and to get all tags to also align in the commit log.

#### Category

Some higher level category for what you've been working on.

E.g.

`AuthService`, `SEBAgent`, etc...

#### Message

Leave a space between the closing parenthesis and the message on the first line.

The message is supposed to give some more insights about ~~WHY~~Â we're doing the commit.

Don't state implementation details that we know from just looking at the code, the more important part is understanding why we changed something for future references. E.g. if some credential triggered to handle something differently in a response model of a provider implementation.

#### Details

For messages that span longer than the first line limit: Leave an empty line, and after that put details about the commit on new lines as you'd like. This could include specifics on why we implemented something like we did, or certain parts that are important to note about the change.

The thought is still that a people going through the code half a year later should be able to figure out why something has changed into what it is today a little easier without full knowledge about the implementation.

## Code  Style

- Do not use static imports in production code. In tests feel free to do so.
- Prefer `equals` to compare objects instead of `==` to avoid cofusion and possible bugs.
